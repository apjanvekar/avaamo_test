OBDX – Loans describes the Loans related requirements that need to be implemented during the move to Digital platform. 
The Loans module will enable the customer to transact and view all his loan transactions. 
The objective of this document is to highlight the following requirements – 
1.	Home Loans
2.	Affordable Housing Loan
3.	Personal Loan
4.	Loan Against Property(Mortgage)
5.	Commercial Vehicles/Used CV
6.	Construction Equipment/Used CE
7.	Health Care Finance (Medical /Printing Equipment)
8.	Gold Loan
9.	Loan Against Securities
10.	Auto Loan/ Two-Wheeler/Used Car


The solution is required for OBDX platform to communicate with Finnone system with request as SOAP over HTTPs to ESB and ESB further communicated with Finnone as Json over Https.
All APIs needs to be converted from SOAP to Json and vice versa with one to one field mapping.


Workflow :- 
1)	OBDX will call ESB API with all relevant information in soap message. Each soap call can be differentiated with API name mentioned in header section of the API (service name needs to be provided by ESB team) also ESB to truncate the headerdetails as per the specified mapping.
2)	ESB will identify the request based on API name and convert the soap into json format as per mapping sheet(refer mapping sheet) and transfer the request to Finone over HTTPs.
3)	Finnone will revert with response in json format over HTTPs only  and ESB will populate the headers .
4)	ESB will convert the request in SOAP format and populate the esbheader fields if required.
